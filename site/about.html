                                This project utilizes the <a href="https://view.data.post45.org/nyttitle" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">New York Times Hardcover Fiction: Titles</a> 
                                data set from the Post45 Data Collective, which records each title on the bestselling hardcover fiction list from 1931 to 2020. It contains 7431 entries.
                                For each entry, the data set tracks the author name, the first year the book appeared on the list, the total number
                                of weeks the book was on the list, the first week it appeared on the list, its debut ranking, and its best ranking.
                                This data set contains information about each unique title, which means that an author can appear multiple times
                                within the data.

                                I also utilize the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/591/gender+by+name" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Gender by Name</a> 
                                data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which associates first names with genders. For each name, the data set tracks
                                whether it is a male or female name, the raw count of the name, and the probability of the name being associated with that gender.
                                The names that appear in this data set were taken from open-source government data from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom,
                                and Australia. The source names data is from the years 1880 to 2019. This data set also does not record genders beyond male and female,
                                which is problematic because it is extremely binary and excludes people who exist beyond male-female categories.

                        <h3 class="card-header">Methodology</h3>

                                I downloaded both data sets from their respective websites. While the Gender by Name data set was provided as a CSV file,
                                the New York Times data set was provided as a TSV file. In my data cleaning process, I first converted the latter data to a CSV file. 

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Furthermore, because my project analyzes perceptions of authors’ genders, I needed to extrapolate author first names from the
                                New York Times data set. So, for each record in that data set, I parsed and split the entry in the author name column into the author’s
                                first and last name. I did this, too, for books with multiple authors. Because my cleaning process was automated, there may be
                                discrepancies between my data and authors’ actual first names – for example, my program may not have accurately recorded an author’s
                                first name if it had multiple segments (ex. Mary Jane). However, due to the size of the New York Times data set, these discrepancies
                                do not make a significant difference in the takeaways from the data.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                After identifying author first names, I combined the New York Times data set with some columns of the Gender by Name data set.
                                For each entry, if the author's first name was more often male than female, I marked it as male, and vice versa. However,
                                there were instances where the author name did not show up in the Gender by Name data set; in these cases, I marked that author 
                                as having an unknown gender. Discrepancies in my data may have also influenced this – inaccurately recording an author’s first name
                                might have meant that their name was unidentifiable in the Gender by Name data set.
