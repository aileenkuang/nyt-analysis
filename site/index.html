        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p> When Chloe Gong’s book, These Violent Delights, made it on the New York Times bestseller list, she said:
            “the size of my ego when distant relatives brag about their kids going to Ivy League schools and my grandma
            pulls the ‘my granddaughter graduated from an Ivy League as a New York Times bestseller’ card.” Gong’s enthusiastic
            reaction demonstrates the cultural relevance of the Times’ bestseller list – being ranked on the list is a marker of
            cultural relevance, or excellence. </p>

        <p> However, the logic behind who gets on the bestseller list is clouded, and suggests that it might not be an accurate
            list at all. According to the New York Times, the data for book sales collected on the list is reported by individual
            book retailers across the country, but the unit sale data is held as confidential. Moreover, according to professor
            Laura B. McGrath, the New York Times’ list has another list working behind the scenes: a list of books that are projected
            to become bestsellers. There is, however, no known methodology behind this list either; in fact, these pre-selected books
            may be manually curated, which introduces the problem of bias and favoritism. And finally, while the New York Times provides
            a short overview of their methods, they do not provide the statistical formulas they use to calculate bestseller rankings.
            Overall, these three factors demonstrate that there is a high potential for bias in the New York Times bestseller list. </p>

        <p> This leads me to the research question at the center of this project: <strong>Are names that are perceived as associated with particular
            genders over or underrepresented on the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list? </strong> How has that changed over time, if at all? 
            I chose to focus on gender as a contributing factor – specifically, perceptions of gender based on first names – because of the 
            phenomenon of name bias. Studies have shown that job applicants with masculine names are more likely to be called in for an interview 
            than applicants with feminine names. Upon finding out that the New York Times’ bestselling titles lists are partially pre-selected, I 
            was interested in how name bias could possibly affect these rankings as well. To address this question in this project, I focus on one 
            particular list: the hardcover fiction bestseller list. I also draw upon two data sets: one with book rankings data, and one with data 
            on the associations between different first names and gender.
