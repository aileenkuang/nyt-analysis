            When Chloe Gong’s book, These Violent Delights, made it on the New York Times bestseller list, she said: “the size of
            my ego when distant relatives brag about their kids going to Ivy League schools and my grandma pulls the ‘my granddaughter 
            graduated from an Ivy League as a New York Times bestseller’ card” (Laidlaw 2023). Gong’s enthusiastic reaction to her book 
            being placed on the Times’ bestseller list – a common reaction among authors to have – demonstrates the cultural relevance
            of the list. It is a marker of excellence, of good writing.


            <br>
            <br>

            However, the logic behind who gets on the bestseller list is clouded, and suggests that it might not be an accurate list at all. 
            According to the New York Times, the data for book sales collected on the list is reported by individual book retailers across 
            the country, but the unit sale data is held as confidential (New York Times). Moreover, according to professor Laura B. McGrath, 
            the New York Times’ list has another list working behind the scenes: a list of books that are projected to become bestsellers 
            (Laidlaw 2023). There is, however, no known methodology behind this list either; in fact, these pre-selected books may be manually 
            curated, which introduces the problem of bias and favoritism. And finally, while the New York Times provides a short overview of
            their methods, they do not provide the statistical formulas they use to calculate bestseller rankings (New York Times). Overall, 
            these three factors demonstrate that there is a high potential for bias in the New York Times bestseller list.

            <br>
            <br>

            This leads me to the research question at the center of this project: <strong>Are names that are perceived as associated with particular
            genders over or underrepresented on the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list?  How has that changed over time, if at all?</strong> 
            Because our society is built on institutions that have historically provided more opportunities for men than women and gender-expansive people,
             I was interested in exploring gender as a contributing factor to biases on the bestseller list. However, I soon ran into an obstacle: with a 
             dataset of around seven thousand bestselling books, it would be simply unrealistic for me to accurately record the gender of all the authors 
             on the list (especially given my time constraints, lack of funding, and limited skillset). And it would be deceitful of me to then present an 
             analysis that I knew had a great potential for inaccuracy. So, I decided to focus on the perceptions of gender based on author first names 
             because of the phenomenon of name bias. Various studies have demonstrated that job applicants with names socially coded as masculine are more 
             likely to advance to the interview stage than applicants with names socially coded as feminine (Cohn 2016). And, since the New York Times’ 
             bestselling titles lists are partially pre-selected, I was interested in exploring whether name bias could impact these rankings as well. 

            
            <br>
            <br>

            In this project, I focus my analysis on one particular list: the hardcover fiction bestseller list. I draw upon a dataset that contains records
            of all the books and authors that have been placed on the list from 1931 to 2020. To encode the names of authors as “male,” “female,” or unknown,
            I use a data set that records associations between common first names in the U.S., U.K., and Australia and gender (male or female). If you are 
            interested, you can find more information on and access my data and methodologies on the “about the data” tab. But right now, let’s get into the 
            findings. 

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            Before we delve further into the findings, I’d like to make a note about my language. For the sake of simplicity and understanding, I will refer 
            to names as “male” or “female” throughout this analysis. I want to make it abundantly clear that I understand that this is extremely binary language,
            and my analysis will not be completely accurate in the sense that, due to the lack of available data, it will exclude non-binary and gender-expansive people. 
        </div>

        <div class="story-header">
            <h3>Male names have dominated the New York Times bestseller list.</h3>

        <div class="story-text">
            Patriarchy and misogyny influence everything in our society, so it isn't surprising to see it reflected in the New York Times bestseller list.
            In the beginning of my analysis, I found that -- out of my data set of around seven thousand entries (which included around 7901 authors) -- 
            4178 were authored by a person with a male first name, 2870 were authored by a person with a female name, and 853 were found to be unknown 
            or indiscernible through gender. In other words: 52.8 percent of the authors on this list have names coded as “male,” while only 36.3 percent
            have names coded as “female.”

            <br>
            <br>

            But fret not! We have made progress over time. According to Rosie Cima, an investigative data journalist who wrote an article for The Pudding
            on this very topic, "women finally made steady gains on the list" during the 1990s, and in 2001, the split between women and men on the list
            was fifty-fifty (n.d.). Due to my time constraints and the limits of my own expertise, I took a different approach to analyzing the Times’
            bestselling titles data, but the general trend that Cima found was reflected in my own analysis. The key takeaway is: over the years, it seems
            that we have been getting closer to gender equality on the bestseller list.

            <br>

        <div class="story-text">

            <br>
            <br>

            And, as Cima writes, this is "good news" (n.d.). In fact, it’s great news – there are more female bestselling authors now than ever before.
            We have representation! At least, it seems that way at first glance. But does this conclusion hold true if we look at different metrics for
            measuring representation? Specifically, let's take a look at the answers to the following three questions:

            <br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Among the book titles that have reached number one on the list, how many of them were authored by people with masculine names?
                    Feminine names? Names with an indiscernible gender?</p></li>
                <li><p>Among the book titles that debuted at number one on the list, how many of them were authored by people with masculine names?
                    Feminine names? Names with an indiscernible gender?</p></li>
                <li><p>Among the top ten titles that have been on the list for the most weeks each year, how many of them were authored by people with masculine names?
                    Feminine names? Names with an indiscernible gender?</p></li>
            </ul>

            <br>
        </div>
            

        <br>

        <div class="container">

                                There's no doubt about it -- the number of #1 bestselling authors with feminine names
                                has increased over time. In 1932, out of the 17 authors that had titles ranked first
                                on the bestselling hardcover fiction list, 10 were authors with masculine names, five
                                were authors with feminine names, and two were authors with names of an indiscernible gender. 
                                For that year, around 29% of the #1 bestselling authors were people with female names. In comparison, 
                                in 2020, 37% percent of the #1 bestselling authors had female names. We are seeing a clear trend towards
                                more female representation among #1 bestselling authors.

    
                                <br>

                                This representation is, however, still not enough to be considered gender equality. Authors with masculine
                                names still make up an overwhelming majority of the #1 bestselling authors on the list.

                                What if we take a look at authors with debut #1 bestsellers on the list? Well, the trend identified previously 
                                holds true. Once again, we are seeing a trend towards more female representation among authors with debut #1 
                                bestsellers on the list. In 1931, all the authors that debuted with a title at #1 had masculine names. But in
                                2020, 7 out of the 19 books on the list that debuted at #1 were authored by people with feminine names (the rest 
                                were authors with masculine names).

    
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                But also, once again, this representation is not enough to be considered gender equality. Authors with masculine names still make up a significant
                                portion of the debut #1 bestselling authors on the list.

                                Finally, we have arrived at the final metric: authors that published books within the top ten books on the list. I measured this for each year by 
                                sorting the bestselling titles by the number of weeks spent on the list. I then, for each year, took the ten titles that had spent the most time 
                                on the bestselling books list. 
    
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                For this metric, still, we see that men dominate. In fact, unlike the last two metrics, there is not even a general trend of improvement over the years.
                                The gender balance has shifted for some years, but overall, it has remained fairly static:  people with male names have authored a majority of the 
                                top ten bestselling books since 1931.

        <div class="story-text">
            My findings do demonstrate that we’ve gotten a lot closer to gender equality – at least in terms of perceived gender – over the last century.
            There are now more authors with female names on the New York Times bestseller list. But it is also extremely clear that we still have a lot 
            of progress to make – my results show that authors with male names still dominate the bestseller list, suggesting the potential influence of 
            name bias.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            True equality does not mean just representation. It is fantastic that authors with female names are faring better on the list than ever before.
             But you know what would be even more fantastic? If more authors with female names made it to the top ten books on the list. If more authors 
             with female names reached #1 on the list. If they debuted at #1 on the list. Just the presence of female names on the list is not enough – female 
             names need to be able to have the opportunity to truly excel once on the list, as well.

            <h3> Thinking Ahead</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            So how do we get to that future? Well, I think that this analysis has only demonstrated the flaws in the New York Times bestseller list. The lack 
            of transparency about their methodologies for ranking books means that we, as readers, will never truly know whether their reporting is accurate. 
            We know now, too, that name bias might influence how well a title fares once it is on the list. And because of the cultural importance of the New 
            York Times bestseller lists, this might influence the books we read, as well. If these rankings are not diverse, our own reading tastes might end 
            up not being diverse, either. And so it would be nice if we were able to change this – if we were able to get the Times to be clear about their 
            methods, or change them to become more equitable. But I know that this isn’t necessarily possible. So I think we can start by reducing the impact 
            these lists have on what we choose to read. Maybe the next time you look for a new book to read, check recommendations from other lists. Look on 
            Goodreads, go to your locally-owned bookstore. Talk to a friend! Only then will we be able to diversify what we read.
